===========

Multi-class classification:

  --> for presentation of results write following script
      --> unweight events to mixing angle alpha=0.2, 0.5, 1.0
      --> for such events plot distribution of predicted weights
          as a function of mixing angle angle
      --> should observe peak at  alpha=0.2, 0.5, 1.0


  --> regression part
      used only MSE as loss function, could try also MAE or HUBNER?
      functional form is not given as additional information.
      Why? could we give it as well or it would not make sens?

Multi-class classification:

  --> try add penalty term for weight between two nearby classes
      being very different.
